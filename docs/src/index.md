## Quick Start

1. Install Julia: [https://julialang.org/downloads/](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
2. Add the SignalingDimension.jl package (run from julia prompt):

```julia
julia> using Pkg; Pkg.add("CVChannel")
```

## Scripts and Numerical Analysis

Numerical results can be found  in the `./script` directory.
Script dependencies can be installed from the `./script/Project.toml`.
