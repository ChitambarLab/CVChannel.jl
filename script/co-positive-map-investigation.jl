In this script we investigate a family of co-positive maps.
Specifically, we investigate the set of states presented in
Eqn. (82) of https://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1655

Note we know co-positive maps have multiplicativity (cite Theorem/proposition
when we have a write-up, I guess), so the only way to check this at all is
implementing the DPS hierarchy.
